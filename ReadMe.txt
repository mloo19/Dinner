Inform Final Project: Dinner


Front Matter:


The player is a steamed bun who has woken up in a steamer. After the player realizes what is happening, they try to avoid being eaten. The NPC is the person who is cooking and wants to eat the steamed bun. The steam bun will encounter three obstacles: first, getting out of the steamer, secondly, moving across the sink, and lastly getting out of the house by building a ladder. In order to win, the player must overcome all three obstacles.


Reflection:
* How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?


        In regards to the game idea and puzzles, the game accomplishes what I set out to do. The only thing I couldn’t accomplish was using the Human NPC more in my game. I wanted to have the NPC follow the player, but I couldn’t figure out a way to inform the player where and when the Human was going to be in the same room as them. Without that, the game would be arbitrary.


* Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.


One place where I got stuck was when coding the first puzzle of the player escaping the steamer. In order for the player to escape, they needed to put the chopsticks in the crack of the cover and then push the chopsticks to open the steamer, so they could escape. Originally, after the player put the chopsticks in the crack, I coded it so that the chopsticks would go into the crack. However, since the crack was closed and openable container, when the player went to push the chopsticks to open the lid, they couldn’t because the chopsticks were in the closed container. To solve this problem, I created another undescribed container that was open, and put the chopsticks in there when the player put the chopsticks in the crack. This way, the player could push the chopsticks to open the container, and the player could only go down if the container was open.


* Describe each of three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle (can be pasted in from your Checkpoints.)


The first puzzle of the game is trying to get out of the steamer. The solution is to put the chopsticks in the crack of the cover and push the chopsticks to pop off the cover. Then the player can escape down. The second puzzle is to get across the sink. The player must get on the sponge and have the chopsticks, so they can row across the sink. The final puzzle is to build a ladder. The player has to have the rice to glue the spoon, spatula, and toothpicks together to build the ladder. Once they are in the window and they have the ladder, they win.


* Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's experience.


I tried to implement the flexibility dynamic in my game. Although, there is only one way to win, there are multiple paths that the player can take to win. I scattered hints throughout my game, so the player could have some guidance, but the player does not need to find every hint in order to succeed. This improves the user’s experience because they could explore the game if they wanted to or they could find the fastest way to win, which makes the game more enjoyable. Additionally, if they missed something, they could still continue and succeed.


* Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game? 


Kai Roberts and two sixth graders tested my game.


* How did their feedback affect your game? 
        
Kai’s main piece of feedback was that the solutions to the puzzles in my game were not totally obvious. Because of his feedback, I tried to include more hints in the game, so the player could successfully solve the puzzles. The sixth graders used more actions that I had not included or thought of, so I included those in my game after they beta tested.


* Whose game did you beta test? 


I beta tested Kai Roberts’ game, which was about a person living on the moon, and their goal was to get a suit and oxygen tank in order to go outside.


* What feedback were you able to give?


When I beta tested his game, he had not yet put in all of the descriptions, so it made it difficult for me to know what I was trying to do or where to go. I suggested that he should put where the other rooms are in relation to the room the player was in, so the player knows where to go. I also suggested he put good descriptions and hints, so the player knows what to do. For example, in one part there is an oxygen tank and a coin, and the coin is supposed to pay for the use of the oxygen tank, but without descriptions, putting the coin in the oxygen tank didn’t make sense.


* What are you most proud of?


        I am most proud that the sixth graders thought my game was fun and engaging. They seemed really excited every time they found a hint or when something unexpected happened (like when the player grows arms).


* What would you do differently next time?


Next time, I would try to plan better. When initially coding the game, I didn’t have a set plan for each puzzle or even all of the rooms. Between classes, I would switch which rooms I wanted and that would affect the puzzles in my game to. For example, at one point in time, I thought it would be cool if the steamed bun got wet in the sink and then expanded to a larger size. However, I did not know how this fit into my overall game, which was to have the steamed bun try to escape. Because my general plan was not set early on, I had a difficult time coding my game because I would code and then delete and restart.
I also should've incorporated the NPCs more into the game. In my game the player interacts with one NPC once and doesn’t interact at all with the other NPC. I wanted to have the second NPC chase the player, but I found that the game would be near impossible because the player could be caught easily by the NPC.
