You wake up in a steaming hot bath. Suddenly, a huge hand lifts the ceiling of the container you are in. Light surrounds you, and you realize you are in a steamer with five other steamed buns. A huge set of chopsticks reach in and grab the steamed bun next to you. You really need to find a way out before you are next.

 You land on the granite surface behind the Cover, so the Human can't see you.  The Human's Cutting Board and a Napkin Holder lie on the surface. After looking around, you see a Window, but it is elevated. You need to figure out a way to get out of the Window.

The Sink is to the east, and the Cabinet is to the West.

The Human is super hungry, and she waits for the steamed buns to finish cooking.

Steamer (on the Sponge)
A round, bamboo steamer resting on a pot of boiling water. The Human's chopsticks rest in the steamer, and five other steamed buns are huddled next to you. The cover is on the steamer, but you notice light coming through a crack in the top.

Steve is a fellow steamed bun huddled in the corner of the Steamer also trying not to be eaten.

"Hi," he replies nervously.

"How long have you been in here," you ask.

"Long enough to know what's about to happen," Steve replies. 

"Do you know how to get out of here?" you ask.

Steve looks around nervously. "I heard the last successful steamed bun was able to escape after eating some green onion from the cutting board. But that was years ago, and you have to figure out how to get out of the steamer."

After hearing this, you decide against talking any further with Steve right now.

Kitchen Table Top (on the Sponge)

The Human is super hungry, and she waits for the steamed buns to finish cooking.

"Hi," he replies nervously.

"How long have you been in here," you ask.

"Long enough to know what's about to happen," Steve replies. 

"Do you know how to get out of here?" you ask.

Steve looks around nervously. "I heard the last successful steamed bun was able to escape after eating some green onion from the cutting board. But that was years ago, and you have to figure out how to get out of the steamer."

After hearing this, you decide against talking any further with Steve right now.

&gt;[1] put chopsticks in crack
You nudge the chopsticks into the crack until you know you have good leverage. Now all you have to do push the chopsticks to get the cover off.

&gt;[2] push chopsticks
You roll onto the end of the chopsticks, making the crack wider. After a couple more seconds, the cover is off, and it falls to the Kitchen Table Top. Now you can escape!

The Human turns to see what the noise was.

&gt;[3] down.
Kitchen Table Top
 You land on the granite surface behind the Cover, so the Human can't see you.  The Human's cutting board and a napkin holder lie on the surface.

The Human is super hungry, and she waits for the steamed buns to finish cooking.

You can also see a Chopsticks, a Cutting Board (on which is a Green Onions) and a Napkin Holder here.

The Human goes towards the the Cabinet.
